Experiment: Optimize Frontend Performance Using Lazy Loading in Single Page Application (SPA)
Objective
To understand and implement lazy loading techniques in a Single Page Application (SPA) using React, React.lazy, Suspense, and React Router to improve frontend performance.

Description
This experiment focuses on optimizing frontend performance in a Single Page Application by implementing both component-level and route-based lazy loading.

Lazy loading ensures that components are loaded only when they are required instead of loading the entire application at once. Using React.lazy() and Suspense, components are dynamically imported and rendered when the user navigates to a specific route.

This approach reduces the initial bundle size and improves application load time, leading to better performance and enhanced user experience.



Concepts Used
Single Page Application (SPA) Architecture
Client-side routing using React Router
Dynamic imports using import()
Component-level lazy loading
Route-based lazy loading
Code splitting using React.lazy()
Fallback UI using Suspense
Performance optimization techniques
Bundle size reduction
What This Experiment Demonstrates
How lazy loading reduces initial JavaScript bundle size
How components are loaded only when required
How route-based lazy loading improves startup performance
How Suspense provides a fallback UI during loading
Seamless navigation without full page reload
Efficient resource utilization in SPAs
Outcome
By completing this experiment, we gain practical understanding of how lazy loading enhances frontend performance in Single Page Applications. We learn how to implement both component-level and route-based lazy loading using React.lazy and Suspense to create scalable and performance-optimized applications.
